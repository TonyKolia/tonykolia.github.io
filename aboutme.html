                <p>Hello, my name is Antonios Koliarakis! I was born on 30/12/1997 and I am from Athens, Greece. Programming is
                    my passion due to my interest in creating things and exploring new ideas. Problem solving also
                    stimulates the brain! I would identify myself as a perfectionist, that never stops until the desired
                    result is achieved.</p>
                <p>My interest in computer science was triggered when I was still a kid playing video games and wondered
                    "How can a picture move when I tell it to?!". After that I started researching with moderate
                    success. It wasn't until my enrollment in university and my first real programming classes that my
                    initial question would finally be answered and I would really understand. And that was when I fell
                    in love.</p>
                <p>When I am not programming you will probably find me in the gym working out while listening to some music,
                    hanging out with friends or watching some quality TV series.</p>

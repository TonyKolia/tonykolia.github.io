                <p>A lending library application, named "iRead", which allows registered users to browse, rate and
                    favorite books as well as make reservations in order to pick up the books from the physical library
                    location. Registered users also receive personalized recommendations and search results as produced
                    by AI algorithms.</p>
                <p>The personalized recommendations and search results for the registered users are generated through
                    the integration of a recommendation system into the lending library application. This recommendation
                    system is based on a hybrid approach, utilizing collaborative filtering and content based filtering
                    algorithms. The collaborative filtering is perform exclusively by a machine learning model. The
                    content based filtering is performed by a custom algorithm which takes advantage of the preferences
                    that the user supplies during the registration process.</p>
                <p>By rating, favoriting and performing reservations, the user implicitly supplies data for the machine
                    learning model which only gets more accurate the more information it gathers about the user's
                    preferences, resulting in more accurate recommendations.</p>
                <p>The application also integrates email services, through which the user activates its account after
                    registration, receives confirmation and details about a new reservation and is able to reset its
                    password.</p>
                <p>A notification system is also present, alerting the user of overtime lendings, newly added books from
                    its favorite categories - authors and availabilty of books that have been marked as favorite.</p>
